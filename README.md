A simple program that runs in the background on windows 10 machines that tend to disconnect bluetooth audio devices when idle.

Just download the dist directory and run an exe file.
There is an error that occurs on the first run. 
The second run every after should be good, printing in console the word "loop" every 15 secs or so.
